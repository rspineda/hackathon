# TitanHacks Website

TitanHacks is a hackathon hosted online. High school students from LA and beyond will come for the weekend and team up to build an app, game, or website. Workshops and raffles mean fun for everyone from the beginning programmer to the seasoned hackathon veteran. After a day of hard work, judges will pick the best projects and give over $8000 in prizes. Come to meet new friends, create something new, and have fun!
